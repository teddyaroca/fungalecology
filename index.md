# About Us

The Stajich lab group is part of the [Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology](https://microplantpath.ucr.edu), [Institute for Integrative Genome Biology](https://iigb.ucr.edu), [Center for Plant Cell Biology](https://cepceb.ucr.edu) at [University of California Riverside](https://ucr.edu). We primarily study Fungi with interests in how they interact with other microbes, plants, animals using genomic, computational, evolutionary and experimental approaches. Our work also encompasses Plant and Insect genomics, Extremophile fungi, Biological soil crusts through active collaborations at UC Riverside and beyond.

Graduate students in our group are members of programs in [Microbiology](https://microbiology.ucr.edu); [Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics](https://ggb.ucr.edu); [Plant Pathology](https://microplantpath.ucr.edu/department-programs/plant-pathology-graduate-program); [Plant Sciences](https://plantbiology.ucr.edu/graduate-program); [Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology](https://eeob.ucr.edu/about-program). Postdoctoral researchers in our group have been trained in variety of biology focused research backgrounds from US and abroad.  Undergraduate students in our group have primarily been [CNAS](https://cnas.ucr.edu) and [BCOE Engineering](https://www.engr.ucr.edu/) majors and members of [University Honors](https://honors.ucr.edu/).
