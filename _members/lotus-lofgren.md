Lotus studies mycology and ecology, write about science, code, and make scientific illustrations. She was a postdoc in the lab from 2019-2021 and is currently a postdoc at Duke University.

Lotus was broadly interested in the mechanisms structuring fungal community dynamics, and address these questions using molecular methods, comparative genomics, population genetics, and bioinformatics. Current projects are focused on fungal host specificity and co-evolution, fungal virulence, guild occupation, trait and genome evolution, and genomic tool development.


Lotus received her Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 2019, working with Dr. Peter Kennedy, and started at the Stajich lab the same year.
When I’m not at the lab, I ride bikes, make ferments and found object art, garden, collect bad 90’s punk music, and (of course), hunt for mushrooms.
I’m passionate about increasing diversity in STEM, inclusive pedagogy, science communication, and bringing attention to issues of access and accessibility across university levels.
