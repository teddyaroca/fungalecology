Dr John Abramyan was one of first members of the Stajch lab and a postdoc from 2010-2011. He worked on the amphibian pathogenic fungus _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ and the gen family CBM18 which we found to be expanded in copy number in this species. His research interests are at the intersection of molecular evolution, reptile development, and tooth evolution. He is currently an Assistant Professor at University of Michigan-Dearborn.
