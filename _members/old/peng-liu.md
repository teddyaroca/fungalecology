Dr Peng Liu was a postdoc and Research Scientist in the group from 2012-15. She worked on projects related to chytrid biology including cultures and extractions from genome projects. Peng also developed an expression system for the CBM18 domain from _Batrachochytrium_ to test its binding affinity to support a hypothesis that it binds chitin and can protect cells from chitinases similar to homologs in plant pathogens. She is currently a scientist at [Yangzhou University](http://english.yzu.edu.cn/) in Yangzhou, China.
