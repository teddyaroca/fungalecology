I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Microbiology & Plant Pathology at the UC Riverside advised by Dr. Jason Stajich. I recieved my Ph.D. in Integrative Genetics and Genomics at UC Davis in Dr. Jonathan Eisen’s laboratory where I studied the seagrass microbiome and seagrass mycobiome. I received my B. A. in Molecular and Cell Biology with a Genetics, Genomics and Development emphasis from UC Berkeley in the spring of 2013. While at UC Berkeley I participated in research in Dr. Ellen Simms’ lab on multiple projects involving rhizobia-legume symbiosis. My current research interests include plant-microbe interactions, the co-evolution of microbes and their hosts, and marine fungi.

I have a varied set of personal interests. I enjoy artistic (knitting, baking, painting, photography, graphic design) outdoorsy (mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, paddle-boarding, backpacking, hiking, hot yoga) and nerdy (board games, books, tv/movies, the occasional video game) pursuits. I am also a proud cat parent.
