I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology at the University of California Riverside, working with Dr. Jason Stajich. I recieved my Ph.D. in Microbiology and Cell Science from the University of Florida, where I was mentored by Dr. Bryan Kolaczkowski. For my Ph.D. I studied the molecular-functional evolution of proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis, as part of the RNA interference pathway. I recieved my B.S. in Biology from Winthrop University, including minors in chemistry and german. While at Winthrop University I worked in the lab of Dr. Jason Hurlbert, where I used crystallographic and computational techniques to investigate the structure of two xylanases involved in the pathogenesis of *Xanthamonas axonopodis* pv.  citri - a causative agent of citrus canker. Currently I have projects working on comparative genomics in Coccidioides, Onygenales, and Fungal evolution.

In my personal time I enjoy several hobbies, including crafting (crocheting, cross-stitch, puzzles), hiking with my dog, mushroom hunting/identification attempts, reading mystery/triller novels, and playing video/computer/board games. I originally hail from Aiken, South Carolina.
