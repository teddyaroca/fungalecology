Our community sequencing project at the JGI was awarded which will allow a consortium of researchers to sequence [1000 fungal genomes](http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/) through the DOE's Joint Genome Institute. The intention is to sample two species from every major lineage of Fungi.Some press releases on the project below and we will coordinate it through several [websites](http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/) including [a forum](http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/forum) for discussion about potential species beyond the target list.- [International Team to Sequence Genomes of Fungi](http://newsroom.ucr.edu/2785)
