A wonderful [symposium reunion](http://mgm.duke.edu/microbial/news/mycology_symposium_2012.html) of alumni and current [Duke](http://mgm.duke.edu/microbial/mycology/) and the [RTP area Mycology and pathogenesis labs](http://mgm.duke.edu/microbial/training/mmptp.htm) is being held April 5 &amp; 6 at [Duke University](http://www.duke.edu). The talks have so far been an interesting collection of model pathogen systems, drug development, and host-pathogen interactions. Tomorrow myself,  Tim James, and others will hit the evolutionary biology of fungi a bit focusing on chytrid pathogens.  Feeling a lot of pride in the training program here at Duke and some nostalgia for days past when many of us were together in the same institution. The gathering is also a celebration of great mentoring and so it is great to see so many of those who taught and mentored us here - in particular [Joe Heitman](http://mgm.duke.edu/faculty/heitman/) was also [awarded a mentoring honor by Duke](http://mgm.duke.edu/microbial/news/heitman_11.html) for his leadership and mentoring.
