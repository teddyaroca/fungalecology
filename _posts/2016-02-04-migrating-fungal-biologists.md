- We said bye to Marco Marconi, visiting student from the [Wilkinson Lab in Madrid](http://www.wilkinsonlab.info/lab/node/17), in December. He worked on some data mining from the 1KFG project and brought some new R tools for looking for enrichment across the CAZY, Interpro, and Pfam differences in species.
