We celebrated a few events in April and May. - A new NSF grant was funded and started in April on rumen fungi "[Phylogenomics and evolutionary history of the anaerobic fungal group, Neocallimastigomycota](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1557110)". This is a collaboration with [Noha Youssef](https://microbiology.okstate.edu/faculty/mostafa/people.html) and [Mostafa Elshahed](https://microbiology.okstate.edu/faculty/mostafa/elshahed.html) at Oklahoma State University and will give the opportunity to work on systematics of these anaerobic gut fungi.
 - Raúl Castanera who came to the lab for a short stay last year, authored a paper that was accepted this week on transposable elements in the Pleurotus (oyster mushroom) genome and comparisons in proliferation rates and impact on gene expression. Castanera R et al. PLoS Gen doi:[ 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006108](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1006108)
 - We just started to get our first microbial diversity (16S and ITS) results for rock and soil communities from California desert environments and Antarctica as part of project by visiting student [Claudia Coleine ](/members/)and [Nat Pombubpa](/members/nuttapon-pombubpa/). Claudia is a PhD student with Laura Selbmann of Tuscia University and visited for nine months, but we processed isolates the lab collected from Antartica expeditions. We are also sequencing genomes of a handful of cultured fungal species from Antarctic locations and the first assemblies look pretty good (200-400 contigs for these 25-40Mb genomes) for a MiSeq only assembly.
 - [Nat](/members/nuttapon-pombubpa/) is collecting samples from Joshua Tree National Park and in collaboration with other desert crust researchers Paul De Ley and Nicole Pietrasiak examining fungal and bacterial distribution.
