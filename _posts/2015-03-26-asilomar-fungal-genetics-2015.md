Another great meeting of [Fungal Genetics](http://www.genetics-gsa.org/fungal/2015/index.shtml) at Asilomar Conference center. Much exciting science, fungal genetics as a field is being driven by genomics and technology but there are nice cycles of experiments coming back to test and validate hypotheses generated from these data. A few pictures of the UCR group all together at dinner.![2015-03-21 19.59.35](/images/wp_upload/2015/03/2015-03-21-19.59.35-1024x768.jpg)![DSCN1511.small](/images/wp_upload/2015/03/DSCN1511.small_.jpg) [![DSCN1510.small](/images/wp_upload/2015/03/DSCN1510.small_-1024x768.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2015/03/DSCN1510.small_.jpg)
