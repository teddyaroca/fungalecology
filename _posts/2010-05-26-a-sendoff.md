We bid farewell last weekend to our lab visitor, [Nastassa Gioti](http://www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/Persons/Anastasia.html), who is headed back to Sweden after 6 fun weeks in Riverside.  We learned from her, and she got to dig into her genome datasets for _Neurospora_ in the context of the comparative and genome annotation tools we have, so it was fun all around!This also marked the second get together (but the first where we remembered to bring a camera). Since we gathered at a local mexican restaurant with whimsical and amazing sculptures and art from recycled material, it was fitting [ we document it with pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/sets/72157624144113608/).[![Everyone together for a meal](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3383/4643529360_8f962528bb.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4643529360/ "Everyone together for a meal by jason.stajich, on Flickr")[![P1010092_0526](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4053/4642915145_996409b566.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4642915145/ "P1010092_0526 by jason.stajich, on Flickr")[![Concrete mushrooms](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4642915827_3261704ae7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4642915827/ "Concrete mushrooms by jason.stajich, on Flickr")[![The air band...](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/4642916233_20df259ba0.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4642916233/ "The air band... by jason.stajich, on Flickr")
