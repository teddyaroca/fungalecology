I had the great opportunity to attend the [International Mycological Congress 10](http://www.imc10.com/2014/home.html) in Bangkok, Thailand during this summer. It was filled with talks from mycologists studying cell biology, genetics, evolution, symbioses, ecology, production of secondary metabolites, and many other aspects of mycology from across the world. It was a great chance to hear about new work in many different experimental systems.  I chaired a session on Population Genomics and GWAS in Fungi and got to hear some great perspectives and approaches on model and non-model systems. I presented my talk on data analysis tools in metagenomics. I got to catch up with many friends/collaborators/colleagues and meet some new folks.I'm jealous of the folks who got to take some of the post-conference excursions through Thailand or ventured even further to Laos and Cambodia. Hopefully next trip to this area I'll have the chance to explore more.![2014-08-06 17.54.21](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/2014-08-06-17.54.21-768x1024.jpg) ![2014-08-05 06.50.26](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/2014-08-05-06.50.26-1024x368.jpg) ![2014-08-03 14.08.02](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/2014-08-03-14.08.02.jpg) ![2014-08-06 18.00.21-2](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/2014-08-06-18.00.21-2-767x1024.jpg) ![2014-08-06 18.41.31](/images/wp_upload/2014/08/2014-08-06-18.41.31-1024x1024.jpg)
