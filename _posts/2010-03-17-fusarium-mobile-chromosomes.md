Congrats to graduate student [Divya Sain](/members/divya-sain) a co-author on a [paper published in Nature](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08850) on mobile chromosomes in _Fusarium_, stemming from her work her work during a rotation in the [Borkovich](http://plantpathology.ucr.edu/new/index.php?page=faculty&i=5&p=1) laboratory.The work highlights the important aspect of how pathogenicity factors can be exchanged via mobile chromosomes and can be an important pathway for adaptive evolution and acquisition of new function through whole chromosome exchange between strains.
