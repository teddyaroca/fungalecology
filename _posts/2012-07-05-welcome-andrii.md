![](http://www.biology.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab/personnel/grygansky.jpg "Andrii")A warm Southern California welcome to Andrii Gryganskyi who is here visiting the lab for several months to work on genomics of Entomophthorales fungi and some other insect-associated fungi from the basal linages.  We're excited to learn from his expertise in phylogenetics and culturing of these strains in the lab. We are helping to assemble and annotate several genomes in progress he has worked on as postdoc at [Duke University](http://www.biology.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab/) to better understand relationships and genomic changes that have occurred some of the basal fungal lineages.
