Last week we hosted several visitors from our ZyGoLife collaborative team in sunny California. I wrote a [few notes on Nicole Reynolds and Javier Tabima's visit](http://zygolife.org/home/2018/04/zygolife-visitors-to-uc-riverside/) for the zygolife site on their extended research stay.

We also got to host the Zygofornia Zygolife team meeting.Â  Here are some pictures I took from the desert and mountain visits.
