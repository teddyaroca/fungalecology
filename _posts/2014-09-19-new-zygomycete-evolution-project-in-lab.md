A new NSF funded project on [Zygomycete](http://zygomycetes.org/) fungi was recently funded. The press release from [UCR](http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/24575) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132716&org=NSF&from=news) provide some more information on the scope of the project and the goals of the new [Genealogy of Life](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14527/nsf14527.htm) initiative at the NSF.We'll be sharing news, data and protocols, and progress on the project website [ZyGoLife.org](http://zygolife.org) and @[zygolife](http://twitter.com/zygolife)  and looking to recruit one graduate student and some undergraduates to work on the projects in our lab focused on genomics and phylogenomic studies of these diverse lineages.
