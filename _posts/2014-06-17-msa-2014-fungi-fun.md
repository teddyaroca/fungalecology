Steven and Jason attended the [Mycological Society of America's 2014](http://msaconference.msafungi.org/) conference in East Lansing, MI. This included  coming in a day early enough for some of us to go on the foray on Sunday after we attended the[ Microbiology of the Built Environment](http://microbiologybuiltenvironment.weebly.com/) conference in Boulder, CO.MSA2104 was a great chance to catch up with friends and colleagues and hear some excellent talks on the current state of research in the fields of systematics &amp; taxonomy; ecology &amp; pathology; genetics &amp; molecular biology. Genomics pervades a lot of the research where it was not quite part of the picture when I first started attending so it was great to see how many people taking advantage of the amazing resources produced by the [JGI sequencing programs](http://jgi.doe.gov/fungi).  I also really enjoyed the Karling lecture from [Bruce McDonald ](http://www.path.ethz.ch/people/members/current_members/bmcdonal)on domestication in fungi and plants and the "dark side" of this domestication (meaning mostly that there are unintended consequences).There was some tweeting going on at the meeting - I tried to capture some with a [storify available here.](http://sfy.co/bjTq)Jason presented research on the evolution of the fungal cell wall examining early diverging lineages of fungi which is the work of former graduate student [Divya Sain](/members/divya-sain/ "Divya Sain").Steven presented his poster on the inhibitory properties of a Chytridiomycota fungus we work on that affects growth of some filamentous fungi and won the award for best graduate student poster!Jason was also honored with the [2014 Alexopoulos Prize](http://msafungi.org/msa-awards/alexopoulos-award/) to honor a young Mycologist. The prize is in memory of [C. J. Alexopoulos](http://lsb380.plbio.lsu.edu/labpersonnel/cja.html) who among other things authored the great Introductory Mycology textbook. I have not yet decided how I will spend the prize money but I intend to support a project in the lab or to support travel for collecting more strains tied to chytrid work.A photo of Steven and Jason at the banquet.![IMG_1645](/images/wp_upload/2014/06/IMG_1645-1024x836.jpg)&nbsp;
