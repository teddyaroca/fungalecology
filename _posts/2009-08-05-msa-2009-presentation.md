My presentation from [BSA/MSA 2009](http://www.2009.botanyconference.org/) on early fungal evolution inferred from the chytrid genome is [available here](http://stajichlab.fungalgenomes.org/presentations/2009-07-28-Stajich_MSA.pdf). Â The conference was great for the time I could be there and the interaction with [mycologists](http://msafungi.org) and botanists at the meeting seemed to be really helpful (I caught a few botany talks) and catching up with new and old friends is a great bonus at these meetings.
