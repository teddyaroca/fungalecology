Congratulations to PhD candidate [Divya Sain](/members/divya-sain/ "Divya Sain"), who just learned she will be awarded a Guru Gobind Singh Fellowship for 2012-2013.  In 1988 the University of California established an endowment to support graduate fellowships (named for Guru Gobind Singh, the Sikh religious leader) to be awarded to graduates of universities in a specific area of India and Pakistan for the purpose of pursuing graduate study at the University of California.Way to go Divya!
