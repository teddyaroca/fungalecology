We've started doing Perl training on Wednesdays for any IIGB and UCR students and postdocs (or curious faculty). This is starting at beginning with command line usage and will hopefully build to advanced bioinformatics. Sofia and Steven are leading these currently and hope it will be a good jumpstart to improving programming skills of our lab and others. Join [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ucr-perl-bioinformatics) if you want to get updates on the meeting times and locations and will also try and post useful slide sets and problems here as well.
