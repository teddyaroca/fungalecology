&nbsp;![Aedes aegypti mosquito](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Aedes_aegypti.jpg "Aedes aegypti")We will be working on discovery of active transposable element discovery in three mosquitos thanks to a grant that began this year from the [W. M. Keck Foundation](http://www.wmkeck.org/).  We will be using Illumina based resequencing of populations of mosquitos, RNA-Seq to study expression of genes and TEs to determine differences between active and silenced elements, bioinformatics to identify and characterize transposable elements in the genomes of 3 mosquitos, and experimentally test for activity of the transposases that are thought to match the target TEs.  The grant is highlighted in a campus [press release](http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&id=2549) and will be a collaboration between our lab and the labs of Dr [Susan Wessler](http://wesslerlab.ucr.edu/), and Dr [Peter Atkinson](http://www.facultydirectory.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/pub/public_individual.pl?faculty=86). Should be a fun exploration and will help inform other TE work in the laboratory as well.
