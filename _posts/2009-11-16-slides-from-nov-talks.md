title: Slides from Nov talks
---
A talk today in the CS department on open problems in bioinformatics and hope to entice some computer scientists to work on more of the problems here.

Here are the slides in [PDF](/presentations/2009-11-16_UCR_CompSci.pdf) and on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/jstajich/2009-11-16-ucr-comp-sci).

I also had a chance to present some work at UCLA in their Bioinformatics series [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/jstajich/2009-11-09-ucla-bioinformatics-talk) are available.
