Congrats to graduate student Yizhou Wang who passed his qualifying exam today. We're proud to have him through this hurdle and to continue working on his research into genome defense and silencing of transposable elements in _Neurospora crassa_.[caption id="attachment_701" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Jason and Yizhou at Asilomar 2011"][![](/images/wp_upload/2011/12/P1000548-300x225.jpg "Jason and Yizhou at Asilomar 2011")](/images/wp_upload/2011/12/P1000548.jpg)[/caption]
