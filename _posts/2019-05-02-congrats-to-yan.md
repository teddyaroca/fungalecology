I am delighted to announce that [Yan Wang](/members/yan-wang/) a current postdoc in our group, will be a starting his next position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at the [University of Toronto-Scarborough.](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/biosci/) Yan has spent the last two years in the lab working on [Zygolife](http://zygolife.org) and Neocallomastigomycota fungi projects.  We are super proud of all he has accomplished in his training and research. This includes multiple publications from his thesis work and several papers submitted from his current projects.  The lab has greatly benefited from his phylogenetic and insect-fungi expertise. Luckily we still have ~6 more month together to continue projects and help him prepare for his next step in his career.
