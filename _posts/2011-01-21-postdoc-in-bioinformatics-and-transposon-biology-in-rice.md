**Postdoctoral Research in Bioinformatics and Transposon Biology in RiceUniversity of California, Riverside**[Position filled as of 6/2011]**Position Description**An NSF funded postdoctoral position is available in the laboratories of Dr Susan Wessler and Dr Jason Stajich to study the evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements in the rice genome and their contribution to phenotypic variation. This postdoctoral scientist will be involved in research using bioinformatics, next generation sequencing of multiple rice strains, and RNA-Seq based transcriptional profiling. This position requires excellent bioinformatics and programming skills to analyze and synthesize genome assemblies from next generation sequencing data produced by Illumina/Solexa technology. Background information on the biology underlying the project can be found in: K. Naito et al, [Nature 2009 461: 131](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08479); K. Naito et al, [PNAS 2006 103: 17620](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0605421103); N. Jiang et al, [Nature 2003 421: 163](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature01214).The successful candidate will be expected to contribute and lead data analysis for the project. There will be opportunities for molecular biology, if desired, as part of validation of analyses. In addition, data and software from this project will be used to develop teaching materials as part of the [HHMI funded Dynamic Genomes](http://www.hhmi.org/grants/professors/wessler.html) course at UC Riverside providing an opportunity to participate in teaching in an innovative topic-focused course for undergraduates. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled and review will begin on February 15, 2011.  Salary and benefits are commensurate with NIH guidelines and the University of California Postdoctoral Union agreement. Special consideration will be given to candidates with exceptional bioinformatics and genome evolution experience.**Qualifications**Minimum qualifications include a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Statistics, or a related field. Demonstrated experience in bioinformatics and high proficiency in programming is necessary along with an understanding of the mechanisms underlying genome evolution. Experience with next generation sequence data is highly desirable. Ability to communicate clearly, work independently, and interact collaboratively is essential.The researcher will also work closely with co-PIs and collaborators at the Boyce-Thompson Institute and Cornell University.**To Apply**Contact Jason Stajich ([jason.stajich@ucr.edu](mailto:jason.stajich@ucr.edu)) or Susan Wessler ([susan.wessler@ucr.edu](mailto:susan.wessler@ucr.edu)) with a current CV and names of three references.More information can be found online about the Stajich lab [http://lab.stajich.org](http://lab.stajich.org/) Wessler lab [http://wesslerlab.ucr.edu](http://wesslerlab.ucr.edu) and UC Riverside [http://www.ucr.edu](http://ucr.edu/).**Information about UCR**In the Heart of Inland Southern California, UC Riverside is located on nearly 1,200 acres near Box Springs Mountain in Southern California, the park-like campus provides convenient access to the vibrant and growing Inland region.
