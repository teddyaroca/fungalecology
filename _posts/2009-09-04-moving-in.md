title: Moving into new Genomics Building
tags: [Moving, Genomics Building]

Well, the doors have been opened and things are moving into the new Genomics building. Since we are so new, no things to really move into the lab as they will come from vendors directly.
I got into my new office with furniture installed and everything. We have ordered some of the big equipment for the lab and started getting supplies. Will be some adjustment as we all learn the new space for the labs on the same floor as we start sharing space, supplies, and also ideas and collaborations. Â An exciting time and with any luck some fun and productive ways of doing science will emerge.
