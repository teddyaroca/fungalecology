UCR undergraduate Jessica De Anda has been working in the lab this summer and Fall will be starting in the [MARC U* STAR program at UCR](http://www.marcu.ucr.edu/).  This program provides mentoring to students interested in pursuing a graduate degree in science and supports laboratory research during the school year and the summers. We're excited she was selected to be part of this program and look forward to her continued work in the lab on aspects of transposon dynamics and evolution in fungi.
