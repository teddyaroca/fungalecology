I can safely say everyone had a good time at Fungal Genetics at the Asilomar Conference Grounds earlier this month. So much fun it too us a week to catch up on sleep and dig out from work left undone. Here are a few pictures from poster presentations. We didn't get everyone's picture captured in the chaotic swirl of the poster session unfortunately.  I'm really proud of how well everyone did and the apparent interest in our projects.I also launched our [fungidb.org](http://fungidb.org) database website at the meeting and got chance to tell more people about our ambitions and hopes for it.  It was also a real treat to see longtime friends and mentors and have the chance to swap stories. <br /><br />[![20110330-073222.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073222.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073222.jpg)<br /><br />[![20110330-073230.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073230.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073230.jpg)<br /><br />[![20110330-073237.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073237.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073237.jpg)<br /><br />[![20110330-073245.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073245.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073245.jpg)<br /><br />[![20110330-073251.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073251.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073251.jpg)<br /><br />[![20110330-073457.jpg](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073457.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2011/03/20110330-073457.jpg)
