With [Bob Schmitz](http://schmitzlab.genetics.uga.edu/) at Univ of Georgia, We're working on a project we call MycoMeth to examine evolution of methylation across Fungi. We would welcome contributions of ~2ug of DNA from diverse fungi that have a sequenced genome.  Please email Jason or [Bob](mailto:schmitz@uga.edu) if you would like to contribute.[![](/images/wp_upload/2017/03/mycometh_slide-1024x768.png)](/images/wp_upload/2017/03/mycometh_slide.png)
