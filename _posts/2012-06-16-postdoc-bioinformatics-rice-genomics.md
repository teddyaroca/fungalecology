[Update 8/2012 - this position has been filled]**Position Description**An NSF funded postdoctoral position is available in the laboratories of Dr Susan Wessler and Dr Jason Stajich to study the impact of a very recent burst in copy number of a transposable element in rice. This work will involve analysis of high throughput genomic sequencing using Illumina/Solexa technology to examine the genomes of hundreds of recombinant inbred lines of rice. This position requires excellent bioinformatics and programming skills to analyze and synthesize genome assemblies, identify polymorphisms, and perform quantitative trait mapping. Background information on the biology underlying the project can be found in: [K. Naito et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19847266), Nature 2009 461: 131; [K. Naito et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17101970), PNAS 2006 103: 17620; [N. Jiang et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12520302), Nature 2003 421: 163.The successful candidate will be expected to contribute and lead data analysis for the project. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled and review will begin on July 15, 2012.  Salary and benefits are commensurate with NSF guidelines and the University of California Postdoctoral Union agreement. Special consideration will be given to candidates with exceptional bioinformatics and genome evolution experience.**Qualifications**Minimum qualifications include a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Statistics, or a related field. Demonstrated experience in bioinformatics and high proficiency in programming is necessary along with an understanding of the mechanisms and methods of studying population biology. Experience with next generation sequence data is highly desirable. Ability to communicate clearly, work independently, and interact collaboratively is essential.The researcher will also work closely with co-PIs and collaborators at the [Donald Danforth Center](http://www.danforthcenter.org/), [Cornell University](http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/), and [USDA ARS Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center](http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=62-25-05-00).**To Apply**Contact Jason Stajich ([jason.stajich@ucr.edu](mailto:jason.stajich@ucr.edu)) or Susan Wessler ([susan.wessler@ucr.edu](mailto:susan.wessler@ucr.edu)) with a current CV and names of three references.More information can be found online about the Stajich lab [http://lab.stajich.org](http://lab.stajich.org/), Wessler lab [http://wesslerlab.ucr.edu](http://wesslerlab.ucr.edu), and the research project [http://dynamiterice.org](http://dynamiterice.org) and UC Riverside [http://www.ucr.edu](http://ucr.edu/).**Information about UCR**In the Heart of Inland Southern California, UC Riverside is located on nearly 1,200 acres near Box Springs Mountain in Southern California, the park-like campus provides convenient access to the vibrant and growing Inland region.
