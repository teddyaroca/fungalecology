Just back from another fantastic Fungal Genetics Conference at Asilomar. An amazing number of helpful tweets under the[ #Fungal17](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fungal17&src=typd) hashtag. [Sarah Unruh](https://twitter.com/sau916) ([@sau916](https://twitter.com/sau916)) and I are talking about how to best archive or building a storify this so it is easier to read. Always a fun meeting to see friends and nosh at the smorgasbord of fungal genetics, epigenetics, genomics, ecology, evolution, and chemistry that is going on. Jason got to give a Plenary talk and express the utility of sequencing fungal genomes in studying their evolution. Lab Alumnus Steven [Ahrendt](https://twitter.com/sahrendt0) won a poster award on his work on Cryptomycota fungi and also gave a talk. [![](/images/wp_upload/2017/03/File_004-1024x888.jpeg)](/images/wp_upload/2017/03/File_004.jpeg)>
