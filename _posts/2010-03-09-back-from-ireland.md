I am back from a short trip to Ireland where I gave a seminar at [National University of Ireland, Maynooth](http://www.nuim.ie/) and spend some time with folks interested in evolution or fungi like [David Fitzpatrick](http://biology.nuim.ie/staff/dfitzpatrick.shtml), [James McInerney](http://biology.nuim.ie/staff/jmbioinformatics.shtml), [Davide Pisani](http://biology.nuim.ie/Evol_Biol_web/index.html). I also learned about a new spinoff company from one of the faculty producing media that [will help Bee immune systems](http://communications.nuim.ie/press/030310.shtml). In my chats with some of the faculty I found out that I had lots in common with [Sean Doyle](http://biology.nuim.ie/staff/sdbiotech.shtml) on _Aspergillus_ and some basidiomycete genomics questions and also much in common with [Gary Jones](http://biology.nuim.ie/staff/gjyeast.shtml) working on prions in yeast.  After my trip to Maynooth, I spent a few days in Dublin afterwards to see the town which included a visit with some Dublin yeast researchers [Ken Wolfe](http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/) and [Geraldine Butler](http://www.ucd.ie/biochem/gb/Lab/) who took me out to see [Newgrange](http://www.newgrange.com/).I learned that there is an abundance of yeast research in Ireland.  In addition to the researchers there is a whole shop devoted to Yeast.[![The Irish Yeast Co](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4420668594_9ea3f4e00e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4420668594/ "The Irish Yeast Co by jason.stajich, on Flickr")And my visit to the Guinness Brewery at [St. James Gate ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4420667736/)taught me that that Yeast is a national treasure in Ireland.[![Yeast!](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4420663328_30a047ba68.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4420663328/ "Yeast! by jason.stajich, on Flickr")Complete with an important safe for insuring there are backup strains.  I have to assume there is a -80 freezer somewhere in the Guinness complex holding old strains as well.[![P1000438-20100309](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4420663436_cb0428873d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4420663436/ "P1000438-20100309 by jason.stajich, on Flickr")Did you know one of the master brewers at Guinness was also the inventor of the [Student's T-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test)?  Here's the proof[![P1000436-20100309](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4420663238_17858f398d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stajich/4420663238/ "P1000436-20100309 by jason.stajich, on Flickr")So it was great to visit and look forward to going back at least in 2012 when [SMBE](http://www.smbe.org/) will be held in Dublin.
