[Nat](/members/nuttapon-pombubpa/) visited New Mexico State University several times this summer to complete work at the [Jornada LTER](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/lter) site working with [Nicole Pietrasiak](https://aces.nmsu.edu/academics/pes/nicole-pietrasiak.html) (@[drylandalgae](https://twitter.com/drylandalgae)) on the micro- and myco-biomes of biological crusts. Visits to [Anza Borrego](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqNxlDmh0wK/) and [Boyd Deep Canyon](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp5902QBLmq/) for Tania to scope out [UCNRS](https://ucnrs.org/) research sites to explore desert rock varnish and rock or crust associated black fungi. [Julia](/members/julia-adams/) continued to develop her [Joshua Tree research sites](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn7EASUgGzS/) for lichen studies and has collected and sequenced new accessions for a reference library of lichens from Joshua Tree NP.Congrats to Jesús (IG: [variety_hour](https://www.instagram.com/variety_hour/)) who [passed his qualifying exam](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmt7VPiAO4W/) has continued to explore [zygomycete diversity](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp0xGS7HINu/) focusing on[ sexual reproduction](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfee1apj8jN/).  Derreck has been working on bacteria-fungal interactions via volatiles and new work with _N. crassa_ sensing of these. [Yan](/members/yan-wang/) has submitted a manuscript on his postdoc work on [phylogenomics and dating the emergence of the the anaerobic gut fungi](https://doi.org/10.1101/401869). [Jinfeng](/members/jinfeng-chen/) has submitted and is revising work on [characterizing the transposition and burst of the _Ping_, _Pong_, and _mPing_ ](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/31/405290)transposable elements across 3000 Rice accessions. [Sawyer](http://sawyer) generated and analyzed whole genome sequence from strains of _Rhizopus stolonifer_ in his population genomics project which he presented at the IMC11 conference.New [publications](http://lab.stajich.org/home/research/publications/) including[ population genomic diversity of Candida lusitaniae](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/10/31/1807698115), [Entomophthorales proteases](http://www.g3journal.org/content/8/10/3311), [space fungi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246146)!, and [fungal](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01392/full) &amp; [bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29865244) communities in Antarctic rocks came out in the last few months.Hopefully another update before the end of 2018 but check out [pictures](https://instagram.com/stajichlab/) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/stajichlab) for shorter updates.
