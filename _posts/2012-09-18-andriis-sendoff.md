Andrii has returned to Durham after a short stint in the lab to pick up some new skills and teach us more about culturing and major questions in Entomophthorales fungi.  He did a nice writeup on [his establishment of a copepod colony ](http://andriigryganskyi.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/copepods-collection-and-breeding-for-coelomomyces-culturing/)which we will use for our future attempt to get Coelomomyces colonies in the lab.He has posted his farewell talk that spans a few of the projects he has been working on his [website](http://andriigryganskyi.wordpress.com/) too -take [a look here](http://prezi.com/yhpmtgh1odfu/ucr-talk-13th-sept-2012/).
