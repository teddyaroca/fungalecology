We are happy to welcome Dr [Ousmane Cisse](/members/ousmane-cisse/) to the lab to work on evolution of multicellularity in Fungi. He will primarily focus on comparative genomics and evolution of filamentous fungal growth in the fungal kingdom, examining the genome of _Neolecta_ and taking advantage of data from the 1000 fungal genomes project and other data sets. He joins us after completing his PhD at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. He focused on comparative genomics of several Taphrinamycotina fungi and will continue this theme working on _Neolecta_. He was awarded a prestigious early postdoc mobility fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation Fellowship.
