Congrats to the lab for a great [Fungal Genetics](http://fungalgenetics.org) meeting. Everyone was participating in the meeting, presenting their work, and hearing about the new things coming out in other research laboratories. Was exhausting pace with 8AM to 10 PM (or later) every day but I think the fun and science excitement overshadowed the tiredness.  Congratulations to Steven [who won a poster prize](http://www.genetics-gsa.org/awards/fungal_posterawards.shtml "GSA") and to Jason for his election to the Fungal Genetics Policy Committee.  [FungiDB](http://fungidb.org) was demoed in a workshop and poster sessions and we seemed to get a lot of interest and feedback along with the excellent presentation by [Omar Harb](http://twitter.com/eupathdb) from the [EuPathDB](http://eupathdb.org) team to lead the workshop.We will post some pictures and upload our poster PDFs in the coming weeks I expect, still catching up on sleep and reengaging in our research after that.Thanks to all who came by to talk with us at our posters and it was great fun to make new friends and reconnected with long-time ones.
