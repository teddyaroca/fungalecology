[![](http://2009.botanyconference.org/logos/Logo8.jpg "BSA_MSA conference")](http://2009.botanyconference.org/)I will be at the [Botany &amp; Mycology conference](http://2009.botanyconference.org/) (mainly to see the [MSA members](http://msafungi.org)) and present a talk on Tuesday morning of the meeting. Hope to run into some old friends and meet new people at the meeting which will see Botanists and Mycologists mixing (oh my). Â I get to stop by Univ of Utah a few days early and give a quick talk and visit with [some friends](http://www.yandell-lab.org/) at the Eccles institute at the U and maybe will get to see a few more Salt Lake City sites.
