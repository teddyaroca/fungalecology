We're excited that several manuscripts were published in the last month.One presents the first [genome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject?term=PRJNA81749) from the Cryptomycota, _Rozella allomycis_, in a manuscript published in [Current Biology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.057) along with a nice companion piece from [Mark van der Giezen](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.048) about the work. [Steven](/members/steven-ahrendt/ "Steven Ahrendt") and [Divya](/members/divya-sain/ "Divya Sain") participating in this project in collaboration with Tim James at Michigan and Nico Corradi in Montreal. Some of the scripts used for this project are available as well [here on github](https://github.com/stajichlab/rozella) and other associated genome data are [available here.](http://fungalgenomes.org/public/chytrid/Rozella/) We are working to get this into the next [FungiDB](http://fungidb.org) release as well.A [manuscript](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23951101) from [Andrii Gryganskyi](http://lab.stajich.org/home/2012/07/welcome-andrii/ "Welcome Andrii") who [was a lab visitor last summer](http://lab.stajich.org/home/2012/09/andriis-sendoff/) was published on the Entomopthorales fungus _Entomophthora muscae._A [review on the application of genomics to mycology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23928422) was published in [Mycologia](http://www.mycologia.org/) celebrating the new era of mycology and the first genome sequences published in this journal.Work from [Anastasia Gioti](/members/anastasia-gioti/ "Anastasia Gioti"), who[ was a lab visitor for several months this year](http://lab.stajich.org/home/2012/10/welcome-back-anastasia/ "Welcome back Anastasia!") and has visited several times in the past years, wrapped up genome comparisons of _Neurospora_ species which have transitioning from outcrossing (heterothallic) to self-fertile (homothallic) lifestyles. Our manuscript was made [available in Evolution](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.12206) this summer and will be published in the Fall.A paper [on the population genomics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23650365) of amphibian killing chytrid fungus _B. dendrobatidis_ that culminated several years of work and large collection of researchers was published in PNAS at the beginning of the summer.
