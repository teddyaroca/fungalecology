A new project is launching for studying the Microbiome of Herptiles and the impacts of specific fungi. The work is supported by the [NSF](https://nsf.gov) [Understanding the Rules of Life: Microbiome Interactions and Mechanisms](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21534/nsf21534.htm) and will support a four year project to examine the dynamics of microbiomes from wild and captive animals, manipulation experiments, and genomic and metabolomic profiling of these communities and individual microbial members.
