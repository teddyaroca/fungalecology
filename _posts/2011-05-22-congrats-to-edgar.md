[![Cap](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2804/4430367825_5e231d3716_m.jpg "Cap")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/friscocali/4430367825/)Edgar Medina has been visiting the lab for the last few months from the [Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia](http://www.uniandes.edu.co/) to work on _Batrachochytrium_ genome evolution.  This past Friday he completed his Master's degree, defending his thesis via Skype.  Was quite fun to see him adeptly switched between Spanish and English in the Q&amp;A period while showing his slides that were remotely projected onto the screen back in Bogotá. It was a real pleasure to have him here for the few months and look forward to a chance to keep interacting on many of our projects.  Way to go Edgar!
