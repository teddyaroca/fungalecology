The past few months have passed quickly but wanted to share a few updates.Jason presented at the [EMBO Eukaryotes](http://events.embo.org/15-eukaryotes/) meeting in Spain, [Mexican Mycology Congress](http://www.congresomexicanodemicologia.com/), Univ of Arizona, attended the [Kavli Frontiers meeting](http://www.kavlifoundation.org/kavli-frontiers-science), co-organized the [Southern California Eukaryotic Pathogens](http://scep.ucr.edu) meeting held again at UCR and taught graduate course on [Programming and Data analyses](https://hyphaltip.github.io/GEN220_2015/).The past few months we hosted [Yinka Odebode ](/members/john-yinka-odebode/)from University of Lagos from August to November. He was supported by the [West African Research Association](https://www.bu.edu/wara/). Yinka learned about ITS sequencing of fungi to identify his isolates in his work in Africa. He also explored properties of dust associated fungi in Nigeria before he returned home in November.[![yinka1](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/yinka1-1024x768.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/yinka1.jpg) [![yinka3](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/yinka3-768x1024.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/yinka3.jpg)We also welcomed Marco Marconi from Madrid for a few months and is working on comparative genomics of fungi using the [1KFG datasets](http://1000.fungalgenomes.org).Starting in  September we welcomed new graduate student in Plant Pathology, Nuttapon Pombubpa (right). Here he is (right) enjoying lunch along with visiting student Claudia Coleine and graduate student [Sawyer](/members/sawyer-masonjones/).[![lablunch1](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/lablunch1-1024x768.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2015/12/lablunch1.jpg)We gathered to say goodbye to project scientist [Peng Liu](/members/peng-liu/) who returned to China in December.
