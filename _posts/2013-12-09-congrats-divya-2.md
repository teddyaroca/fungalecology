We congratulate Divya on defending her dissertation on "Discovery of fungal cell wall components using evolutionary and functional genomics".  Her last revisions and formatting is taking place and she should be the first minted PhD from the Stajich lab before Christmas.  We are happy and proud of her accomplishment to complete this important milestone!&nbsp;![DSC_1653.smaller](/images/wp_upload/2013/12/DSC_1653.smaller.jpeg) ![DSC_0073.smaller](/images/wp_upload/2013/12/DSC_0073.smaller.jpg) ![DSC_0078.smaller](/images/wp_upload/2013/12/DSC_0078.smaller.jpg)![DSC_0079.smaller](/images/wp_upload/2013/12/DSC_0079.smaller.jpg)&nbsp;
