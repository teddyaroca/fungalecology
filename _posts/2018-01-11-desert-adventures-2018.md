Nat and Jason headed out to the [Mojave National Preserve](https://www.nps.gov/moja/index.htm) to meet up with [Erik Hom](http://darwinsdaemon.com/) and his [StudyUSA class](http://www.outreach.olemiss.edu/study_usa/california_winter_18.html) from Univ of Mississippi. We started at the [Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Research Center](http://granite.ucnrs.net/) which is one of 39 [Natural Reserves](https://ucnrs.org/) in the University of California.  We were there to teach a bit about cryptogamic crusts, show the Kelso dunes off, and explore some more of the desert crust sampling sites that our collaborator [Nicole Pietrasiak](http://aces.nmsu.edu/academics/pes/nicole-pietrasiak.html) ([@drylandalgae](http://twitter.com/drylandalgae)) and [Paul De Ley](http://nematology.ucr.edu/deley.html) have collected from. Nothing like seeing sites that previously I only knew from pictures or tubes of soil!A few pictures from our visit.[![IMG_6972](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4756/39640363651_4eeb04c69c_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/39640363651/ "IMG_6972")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_6970](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4612/39640362911_ccb937957f_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/39640362911/in/photostream/ "IMG_6970")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_6950](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4747/38743950315_1ef07be2ad_h.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/38743950315/in/photostream/ "IMG_6950")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_2316.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4724/38743913725_9b3309f3f5_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/38743913725/in/photostream/ "IMG_2316.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Kelso Dunes[![IMG_2282.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4701/27862078659_32a8184f71_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/27862078659/in/photostream/ "IMG_2282.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Crusts symbioses of algae and cyanobacteria with fungi, bacteria, and many uncounted single celled organisms.[![IMG_2290.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4624/24771968967_3b8aabb6e8_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/24771968967/in/photostream/ "IMG_2290.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_2288.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4607/38743818115_cb144735fd_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/38743818115/in/photostream/ "IMG_2288.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Lichen Crusts galore across from the Kelso dunes[![IMG_2300.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4715/39610363022_a982213054_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/39610363022/in/photostream/ "IMG_2300.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_2299.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4717/24771977087_7fbd04ce18_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/24771977087/in/photostream/ "IMG_2299.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_2295.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4709/24771975757_a0a4b020d8_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/24771975757/in/photostream/ "IMG_2295.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Moss Crusts are also rich symbioses with a predominant moss.[![IMG_2312.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4696/24771988147_bdeb66712e_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/24771988147/in/photostream/ "IMG_2312.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Old volcanic flow in the Cima area also has cacti and crusts[![IMG_2331.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4705/27862219679_846a77d108_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/27862219679/in/photostream/ "IMG_2331.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>[![IMG_2328.20180111](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4660/27862218949_9cc3dbb3c0_b.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stajichlab/27862218949/in/photostream/ "IMG_2328.20180111")<script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Colorful lichens found on the granite faces.
