Talks from the Sloan Foundation sponsored session at Lake Arrowhead meeting on Microbiology of the Built Environment are now posted on [Microbe.net ](http://microbe.net)(which was jokingly pronounced as micro-beignet by some) including my talk on fungi in the Built environment.  [Go take a look](http://www.microbe.net/2012/10/01/recorded-talks-from-lake-arrowhead-lamg12-james-meadow-jason-stajich-susana-remold/) if you want to see an overview of some of the ways researchers are studying microbes in the built environment.  The [Microbe.net](http://microbe.net) team also recorded [an interview with me](http://www.microbe.net/2012/09/18/people-behind-the-science-interview-videos-jason-stajich-fungi-and-databases/) about our work on the MicroBE data coordinating center and work to make identifying fungi from metagenomic sequencing easier.
