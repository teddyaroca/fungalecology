A few papers from our work are now appearing. This includes several collaborative papers that have been in progress for several years, so I'm happy to see them published.- See the latest issue of PLoS Genetics for our work on analysis of the [transcriptome during meiosis](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001135) in _C. cinerea _in collaboration with [several labs](http://www.bio.unc.edu/Faculty/pukkila/) at [UNC-CH](http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/lieb/), [Indiana University](http://www.bio.indiana.edu/faculty/directory/profile.php?person=mzolan), and [SEMO](http://genome.semo.edu).
- A chapter on bioinformatics [protocols ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836076)for using the [Gbrowse_synteny](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse_syn) tools
- The final version of our paper from a collaboration with Kristina Smith and [Mike Freitag](http://www.mcb.oregonstate.edu/faculty/freitag), [Deb Bell-Pedersen](http://www.bio.tamu.edu/facmenu/faculty/Bell-PedersenD.htm), and [Michael Brunner](http://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/kolleg/kolleg-zellbio/Brunner.html) labs on [ChIP-Seq and profiling of the White Collar Complex in Neurospora](http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.00154-10) to identify the network of genes regulated by light.
