The end of the quarter was a blur but I wanted to properly congratulate Yizhou Wang. Dr Wang successfully defended his PhD in December and submitted his dissertation "Discovery and Properties of Small RNAs from Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA in _Neurospora crassa_"  in the Plant Biology graduate program. He is our newest graduate from the lab and we couldn't be happier and proud for him. He was able to complete a concentration MS in Statistics at the same time and was able to master bioinformatics and data analysis of next generation sequencing and comparative genomics along with small RNA Northerns, Southern Blots, and _Neurospora_ culturing and care. He has been a great asset to the lab and I am delighted that he has finished this part of his education and training and excited for his next steps.![Yizhou_Asilomar_1](/images/wp_upload/2014/12/Yizhou_Asilomar_1.jpg)He is serious about his cooking, treating us to some great meals from BBQ to a Chinese seafood extravaganza.![Yizhou_cooking](/images/wp_upload/2014/12/Yizhou_cooking.jpg)
