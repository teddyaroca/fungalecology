This week the summer student programs ended and Carlos Rojas, Ramy Wissa and Lorena Rivera all gave presentations and posters on their work.  We really enjoyed having them around for the summer and look forward to their possible continuation in the Fall.Carlos worked with postdoc John Abramyan on the CBM18 gene family in _Bd_to confirm gene expression of the members of the family by RT-PCR before we choose a subset to work on further.[caption id="attachment_638" align="aligncenter" width="614" caption="Carlos Rojas explaining his poster on CBM18"][![](/images/wp_upload/2011/08/Photo-Aug-25-11-54-02-AM.jpeg "Carlos Rojas explaining his poster on CBM18")](/images/wp_upload/2011/08/Photo-Aug-25-11-54-02-AM.jpeg)[/caption]Lorena and Ramy worked with graduate student Divya Sain on a screen of _Neurospora_strains with candidate cell wall genes knocked out.  They completed a screen of 115 mutants x 3 replicates = a lot of petri dishes for their first time in the laboratory. Below is a picture of Ramy and Lorena with their peers from the MARCU program.[caption id="attachment_643" align="aligncenter" width="1024" caption="The 2011 MARCU* students gather before their presentations"][![](/images/wp_upload/2011/08/Photo-Aug-26-1-44-18-PM1.jpeg "MARCU* students")](/images/wp_upload/2011/08/Photo-Aug-26-1-44-18-PM1.jpeg)[/caption]
