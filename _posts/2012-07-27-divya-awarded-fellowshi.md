Congratulations to [Divya](/members/divya-sain/ "Divya Sain") who was awarded the Guru Gobind Singh Fellowship for 2012-13! This fellowship is awarded to one graduate student in the UC system who is a student of an Indian or Pakistani university and committed to returning to her country of origin after receiving her doctoral degree at a UC campus. This is a great honor and we're all proud of Divya for applying for and receiving the award.  An [article in UCR Today](http://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/7959) describes her work and the award.
