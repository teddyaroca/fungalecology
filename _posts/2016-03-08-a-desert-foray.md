We started some explorations on fungi in desert crusts this week with a project in Joshua Tree National Park. Nuttapom received a [Robert Lee Graduate Student research grant](http://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/nature/grantprogram.htm) to explore impacts of visitor disturbance on biodiversity of desert crusts in JTNP.  Nat with the help of Claudia, Derreck, and [Prof Mike Allen](https://plantpath.ucr.edu/people/faculty/allen.html) did a first exploration of a few sites.  We are happy to see some rain falling this week so there should be some changes to the crusts in some subsequent visits this week and weekend and [coinciding with a workshop on desert crusts in the park](https://www.joshuatree.org/desert-institute/field-classes/biological-soil-crusts-2/) this weekend. Here's a few pictures of the team out in the field last week.[caption id="attachment_1475" align="aligncenter" width="863"][![Mike leads the team](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/Mike_leads_the_team.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/Mike_leads_the_team.jpg) Mike and Derreck ahead in Hidden Valley[/caption][caption id="attachment_1477" align="aligncenter" width="604"][![Nat Sampling](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/Nat_Sampling-1024x683.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/Nat_Sampling.jpg) Nat, getting his first taste of sampling in the desert.[/caption][caption id="attachment_1473" align="aligncenter" width="604"][![Claudia looking for sandtsone associated fungi](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/ClaudiaDerreck-1024x576.jpg)](/images/wp_upload/2016/03/ClaudiaDerreck.jpg) Dereck and Claudia helping to look for crusts.
