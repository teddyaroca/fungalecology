The lab gathered in August at the UC Nature Reserves - [James Reserve](https://james.ucnrs.org/) for our first retreat. It was a chance to reconnect, take some hikes and spot some natural diversity in the San Jacinto Mountains (originally [Cahuilla lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahuilla)).

We got to explore the Reserve on some hikes

We walked around Lake Fulmor just outside of the reserve. We took some water samples and spent some time looking at the creatures and algae under the scope as well.
