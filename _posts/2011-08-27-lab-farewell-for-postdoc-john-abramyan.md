We wished postdoc [John Abramyan](/members/john-abramyan/) a farewell and happy trails last week.  He was the first postdoc to join the lab and completed a projects relating to _Bd, _[chytrid](http://lab.stajich.org/home/tag/chytrid/) cell wall genes, and some a gene regulation bioinformatics project. He also was main force in getting the experimental portion of our lab started when the group was established.  John is moving on to work on vertebrate evolutionary questions at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver, BC, CANADA. We'll miss having him in the lab and wish him much luck in his next adventure.
